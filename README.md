# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect DOM Element Removal

This repository demonstrates a subtle but important bug in HTML related to removing DOM elements.  Improper removal can lead to memory leaks, especially if event listeners are attached to the element being removed. 

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect approach, and `bugSolution.html` presents the correct solution.

## The Bug

The incorrect code utilizes `outerHTML = ""`, which removes the element from the DOM, however, it doesn't necessarily clean up associated event listeners.  This can lead to memory issues. 

## The Solution

The correct approach uses the `remove()` method. This method is cleaner and automatically handles the removal of event listeners.
